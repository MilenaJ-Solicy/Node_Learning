# Node_Learning

**Node.js Learning Project:**

This repository is dedicated to a Node.js learning project. The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Node.js and related technologies. Throughout this project, I have implemented various features, including models, migrations, seeders, and CRUD operations for some of these models.

**Project Structure:**

_models:_ This directory contains the data models used in the project. These models define the structure and behavior of the data entities we are working with.

_migrations:_ The migrations folder houses database migration scripts. Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema as the project evolves.

_seeders:_ Seeders are scripts that populate the database with initial data. This helps in setting up a consistent starting point for the application.

**Implemented Features:**

We have successfully implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for some of the models in the project. This enables us to interact with and manipulate the data stored in our database.
